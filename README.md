# sxBRZ
A Swift port of the [xBRZ](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbrz/) high quality image upscaling filter by Zenju

#### This project is a WIP.

It is not production ready and performance optimized. 
If you need that please use the [original library.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbrz/)
In the near future I will do a benchmark test and refactor the code to comply to Swift guidelines and practices more.

#### This project also contains the [original library](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbrz/) and an Objective-C wrapper to use it directly from Swift. 

The wrapper was made after [romitagl's example](https://github.com/romitagl/shared)
